# Microprocessor-Based-Temperature-Controller

The Microprocessor-Based Temperature Controlled Fan System is a project designed to create an efficient and automated solution for regulating temperature in enclosed spaces. The system employs a microprocessor, temperature sensors, and a fan to maintain a desired temperature setpoint within the environment. This project aims to provide enhanced comfort, energy efficiency, and convenience by intelligently controlling the fan's speed based on the ambient temperature.
